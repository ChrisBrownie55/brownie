Hello, world. This is my first blog post. It's actually just filler content but you're not supposed to really know that. So let's move past that. Today, I'm here to tell you about why there should always be a comma between the words "Hello" and "World" in the popular programming term "Hello World".

## Importance of the comma

The comma signifies the important distinction between the message, "Hello", and whom it is directed at, the "World". To not use the comma here would be a clear violation of the English language.

```javascript
function test(wow = ['wow']) {
  return console.log('This is a test', wow)
}
```

That was a test code block, yeet!
